The (official) Angular Full Stack version can be found [here](https://github.com/JanMP/vote).

###Todo
+   get a username for users that logged in with twitter
+   validation (especially of votes with no radio selected)
+   an admin role, so I don't have to use the mongo shell to delete crappy test-polls from lazy users that just enter random letters 
+   comments and social buttons
+   tweak the layout
